-- Models tried so far --

# Baseline model: RMSE of 1.58


## Baseline with Adam optimizer and lr=1e-4 : RMSE of 1.29

## Same model as above but with dropout=0.3 in all layers: RMSE of 1.40

## Now only with dropout=0.3 in the linear layers: RMSE of 1.24

## Changed dropout to 0.2 and 0.4 but it didn't give better results than dropout=0.3


### Tried making a more simple model by keeping the baseline model the same but removing the 4th CNN layer: RMSE of 1.65
